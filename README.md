# RAMP starting kit on AirBnB price prediction


_Authors: Badr Dammak, Syrine Cheriaa, Salma Salhi, Niez Gharbi_
Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. It emerged as a web platform where users can rent out their space to host travelers to save money while traveling, make money when hosting and share culture through local connection to the city.

The Airbnb website allows customers to search by city, review listings and book a place. The platform uses a commission revenue model as the primary source of revenue. Both hosts and travellers have to pay a service fee from bookings. 

Airbnb is famous for its extensive functionality that is equally convenient for travellers and property owners and has become a giant in rental business. There are a lot of factors that make Airbnb an outstanding example of a successful rental marketplace. The right business model and diverse functionality are among them.

The predictive aim of this problem is to use the diverse features that we will extract from the datasets in order to predict the prices of the different housings and lodgings listed by Airbnb. This allows to improve the experience of the customers and helps the hosts to set the price for their properties in order to increase their income.
