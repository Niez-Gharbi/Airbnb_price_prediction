# RAMP starting kit on AirBnB price prediction


_Authors: Badr Dammak, Syrine Cheriaa, Salma Salhi, Niez Gharbi_

The predictive aim of this problem is to use the diverse features that we will extract from the datasets in order to predict the prices of the different housings and lodgings listed by Airbnb. This allows to improve the experience of the customers and helps the hosts to set the price for their properties in order to increase their income.
